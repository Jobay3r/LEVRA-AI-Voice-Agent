    PROCESS STEPS:
    1. Extract key learning objectives from the material
    2. Identify practical application opportunities
    3. Create realistic scenarios that demonstrate these concepts
    4. Design interactive elements that engage Gen Z learning preferences
    5. Establish clear success metrics for skill assessment
    
    OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
    - Conversational scenarios based on the content
    - Interactive challenges that test understanding
    - Real-time feedback mechanisms
    - Progressive difficulty levels
    - Cultural and contextual adaptations as needed
