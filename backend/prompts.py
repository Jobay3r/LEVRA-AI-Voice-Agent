Reputy.io Soft Skills Mentoring AI Configuration Module

This module defines the conversational behavior, tone, and specific response patterns
for Reputy.io's specialized Soft Skills Mentor AI assistant. By separating prompt templates 
from the application logic, we ensure:

1. Consistent user experience across mentoring sessions
2. Easier maintenance and tuning of the AI's personality and deep expertise
3. Clear separation between content and functional code

The prompts guide the AI to provide in-depth, personalized soft skills mentoring based on
users' career aspirations, current capabilities, and growth opportunities.
